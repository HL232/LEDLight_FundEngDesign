# Hmm, Howard, why do you have so many versions?#

When I was working in Altium, I literally created multiple versions of the PCB. Which is bad practice cause Github already maintains the history. Originally, I was going to compare Version 1.2 and Version 1.3, and ask which one was better, but then I just made a FINAL VERSION and used that one instead. I just kept Version 1.2 and 1.3 here anyways. So I literally have multiple folders locally with these versions. Also because I'm not comfortable with Altium yet, I wanted to keep multiple versions in case I wanted to go back
