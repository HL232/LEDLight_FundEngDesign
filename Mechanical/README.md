# What's in this folder:
This folder has my Solidworks files for printing my hardware case. 

##Version 1
This is an old Solidworks case I printed from a previous project. I didn't want to use this as my final version, so I made a second version.

##Version 2
This version is a __COMPLETELY__ different Solidworks file. I started from scratch to make this final version of my hardware. Which is why there is Version 1 and Version 2. I did not build Version 2 based on Version 1, therefore I needed to have two folders. 

Also note: The reindeer on top of my LED light is a character called Tony Tony Chopper from the Japanese manga One Piece. The print was obtained online here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1452830
